        pointed out they want to keep technical discussions directly related to the
        API on the mailing list.\n\nIf you have photos or screenshots that illustrate
        your use of the API, then feel free to add them. Please be selective though
        - people don''t necessarily want to see a dozen almost identical screenshots
        of your app - just one or two that show off the most interesting aspects.

        or Sunsets. They will be rejected."},"rules":{"_content":"This group is dedicated
